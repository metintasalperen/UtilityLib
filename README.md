# UtilityLib

Provides following utilities:
1. String Utility functions
2. File IO Utility functions
3. Winsock2 wrapper classes for TCP/UDP Server/Client use cases
4. Tftp Client and Server implementations
5. Bit Manipulation Utility functions
6. Miscancellous algorithms
And Hopefully more things to add as I find new ideas...
